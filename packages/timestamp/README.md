[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@angular-builders/timestamp.svg) ![npm (tag)](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@angular-builders/timestamp/next.svg) ![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/@angular-builders/timestamp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular-builders/timestamp)

This builder is an example from the Medium article [Angular CLI 6 under the hood â€” builders demystified](https://medium.com/@just-jeb/angular-cli-6-under-the-hood-builders-demystified-f0690ebcf01).

## Usage

1. In the root of your Angular application:
   ```console
   npm i -D @angular-builders/timestamp
   ```
2. In your _angular.json_ add the following to _architect_ section of the relevant project:

   ```json
   "timestamp": {
     "builder": "@angular-builders/timestamp:file",
     "options": {}
   },
   ```

3. Run: `ng run [relevant-project]:timestamp`
   Where _[relevant-project]_ is the project to which you've added the target

## Options

- `path` - path to the file with timestamp, defaults to `./timestamp`
- `format` - timestamp date format, defaults to `dd/mm/yyyy`
