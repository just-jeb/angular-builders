# Jest builder for Angular build facade
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40angular-builders%2Fjest.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40angular-builders%2Fjest)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular-builders/jest.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular-builders/jest)
![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg)  

Allows running `ng test` with Jest instead of Karma & Jasmine.  
The builder comes to provide zero configuration setup for Jest while keeping the workspace clear of boilerplate code.

## Prerequisits
  - [Angular CLI 6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@angular/cli)
  - [Jest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest)
## Installation

1. Remove Karma related libraries and files:
   ```Shell
     npm remove karma karma-chrome-launcher karma-coverage-istanbul-reporter karma-jasmine karma-jasmine-html-reporter
	 rm src/karma.conf.js
	 rm src/test.ts
   ```
2. Install the builder (and `jest` if you still haven't): `npm i -D jest @angular-builders/jest`

## Updating Typescript configurations

Although you run your unit tests with Jest, Protractor (e2e tests) still [has to use Jasmine](https://github.com/angular/protractor/issues/3889).
Due to this fact it's possible that you favorite IDE will get confused with the typings and will propose you Jasmine types in unit tests or Jest types in e2e test.
In order to avoid that kind of problems you have to specify the types explicitly:

1. In _tsconfig.spec.json_ (_src_ directory, used by Jest): 
	```js
	"compilerOptions": {
		...
		"module": "commonjs",
		"types": ["jest"]
	} 
	```
	Make sure the module is `commonjs`, otherwise tests will fail at imports.

2. In _tsconfig.json_ (root directory, used by IDE): 
	```js
	"compilerOptions": {
		...
		"types": ["jest"]
	} 
	```

## Running with Angular CLI
  - In your `angular.json`:
     ```js
     "projects": {
         ...
         "[your-project]": {
              ...
              "architect": {
                     ...
                     "test": {
                               "builder": "@angular-builders/jest:run"
                               "options": {
                                     ... //see below
                               }
      ```
  - Run the tests: `ng test`  
  
## Multi-projects workspace support
The builder supports multi-project workspaces out of the box, the only thing required is editing _tsconfig.spec.json_ in the relevant project directory as described [above](#updating-typescript-configurations).
  
## Builder options
 - `configPath` - path to jest config file, relative to _project root_ (or src/ directory in case of non-project app), defaults to `jest.config.js`. 
   The configuration is merged on top of the default configuration, so there is no need to specify the whole jest configuration in this file. Just specify the _changes_ you'd like to make to the default configuration.
   The way the configurations are merged is as following:
   1. Take the [default configuration](https://github.com/angular-builders/jest/blob/master/src/jest-config/default-config.ts) from the library
   2. Add on top of it default project specific config (that is dynamic due to different root directories). Used to scope single project test runs.
   3. Add on top of it _package.json_ jest config if exists (for **all** projects)
   **or** 
   _jest.config.js_ from workspace root directory if exists
   4. Add on top of it project specific config if it is specified inside _angular.json_
   **or**
    _jest.config.js_ from project directory (or src/ directory in case of non-project app) if exists.  

   Thus, if you don't provide `configPath` in options, and you'd like to customize the configuration of a single project in your workspace, you only have to add _jest.config.js_ in this project's root directory and specify the configuration delta in this file.  
   Or, if you'd like the same custom configuration to be applied to all the projects in the workspace, you just specify it in _package.json_. Another option in such a case is creating a single config file in the workspace root and specifying it in _angular.json_ for each project.
 - `[jest-cli-option]` - any option from [Jest CLI options](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/cli.html). For example, to run unit tests without caching and with `junit-reporter` use:
   ```js
   "options": {
		"no-cache": true,
		"reporters": "jest-junit"
   }   
   ```
   These options can also be provided directly to `ng test` command. For example, to run a single test from this suite:
   ```js
    describe("My cool suite", () => {
       it("Should do one thing", () => {
    		...
       })
       
       it("Should do another thing", () => {
    		...
       })
    })
   ```
   Use the following command: `ng test --testNamePattern="My cool suite Should do one thing"`
