# Migration from version 10 to version 11

## Custom webpack builder
1. `mergeStrategies` field in `customWebpackConfig` has been deprecated, use `mergeRules` instead as defined [here](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge#mergewithrules).  

In order to make this breaking change as backward compatible as possible, the default value of `mergeRules` is the following:
```ts
{
  module: {
    rules: {
      test: "match",
      use: {
        loader: "match",
        options: "merge",
      },
    },
  },
};
```
This is as close as possible to the [`smart` merge strategy](https://github.com/survivejs/webpack-merge/tree/v4.2.2#smart-merging) that was used before, so ideally if you didn't use `mergeStrategies` then your configuration should work just as it worked before.  
Otherwise you'll have to adjust the `mergeRules` in accordance with your needs.

# Migration from version 9 to version 10

## Jest builder
1. Update to Jest 26 if you still haven't.

# Migration from version 8 to version 9

## All builders
1. `@angular/architect` and `angular/core` are now direct builder dependencies, therefore no need to specify them explicitly in `package.json`

## Jest builder
1. jest-preset-angular version has been updated to 8. If you have any custom Jest configuration, make sure it matches the preset [version](https://github.com/thymikee/jest-preset-angular/releases/tag/v8.0.0).

2. If you're using Ivy (enabled by default in version 9) make sure you run `ngcc` in a `postinstall` hook. For more details refer to [this](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/issues/679#issuecomment-587525674) issue.

# Migration from version 7 to version 8

## Custom webpack builder
1. `index.html` is no longer generated with Webpack. This means if your solution uses Webpack to alter `index.html` it will stop working the moment you upgrade to version 8.  
Instead you should use [`indexTransform`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/blob/master/packages/custom-webpack/README.md#index-transform) property.

## Dev server builder
1. `@angular-builders/dev-server:generic` has been deprecated. Use [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server`](https://github.com/just-jeb/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack#Custom-webpack-dev-server) instead.

## Jest builder
1. Update to Jest 24 if you still haven't.
