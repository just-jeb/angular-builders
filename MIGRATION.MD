# Migration from version 7 to version 8

## Custom webpack builder
1. `index.html` is no longer generated with Webpack. This means if your solution uses Webpack to alter `index.html` it will stop working the moment you upgrade to version 8.  
Instead you should use [`indexTransform`](https://github.com/meltedspark/angular-builders/blob/master/packages/custom-webpack/README.md#index-transform) property.

## Dev server builder
1. `@angular-builders/dev-server:generic` has been deprecated. Use [`@angular-builders/custom-webpack:dev-server`](https://github.com/meltedspark/angular-builders/tree/master/packages/custom-webpack#Custom-webpack-dev-server) instead.

## Jest builder
1. Update to Jest 24 if you still haven't.
