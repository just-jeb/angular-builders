Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\n      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\n      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\n      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\n\n   7.

Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\n      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,\n      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\n      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\n      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\n      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\n\n   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.\n\n      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following\n      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets \"{}\"\n      replaced with your own identifying information.

It will only work as a jest reporter. See the docs just below this for how to transition your project.\n\n## Usage\nIn your jest config add the following entry:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"reporters\": [ \"default\", \"jest-junit\" ]\n}\n```\n\nThen simply run:\n\n```shell\njest\n```\n\nFor your Continuous Integration you can simply do:\n```shell\njest --ci --reporters=default --reporters=jest-junit\n```\n\n## Usage as testResultsProcessor\nIn your jest config add the following entry:\n```JSON\n{\n  \"testResultsProcessor\": \"jest-junit\"\n}\n```\n\nThen simply run:\n\n```shell\njest\n```\n\nFor your Continuous Integration you can simply do:\n```shell\njest --ci --testResultsProcessor=\"jest-junit\"\n```\n\n## Configuration\n\n`jest-junit` offers several configurations based on environment variables or a `jest-junit` key defined in `package.json` or a reporter option.\nEnvironment variable and package.json configuration should be **strings**.\nReporter options should also be strings exception for suiteNameTemplate, classNameTemplate, titleNameTemplate that can also accept a function returning a string.\n\n| Environment Variable Name | Reporter Config Name| Description | Default | Possible Injection Values\n|--|--|--|--|--|\n| `JEST_SUITE_NAME` | `suiteName` | `name` attribute of `<testsuites>` | `\"jest tests\"` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR` | `outputDirectory` | Directory to save the output. | `process.cwd()` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_NAME` | `outputName` | File name for the output. | `\"junit.xml\"` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_UNIQUE_OUTPUT_NAME` | `uniqueOutputName` | Create unique file name for the output `junit-${uuid}.xml`, overrides `outputName` | `false` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_SUITE_NAME` | `suiteNameTemplate` | Template string for `name` attribute of the `<testsuite>`. | `\"{title}\"` | `{title}`, `{filepath}`, `{filename}`, `{displayName}`\n| `JEST_JUNIT_CLASSNAME` | `classNameTemplate` | Template string for the `classname` attribute of `<testcase>`. | `\"{classname} {title}\"` | `{classname}`, `{title}`, `{filepath}`, `{filename}`, `{displayName}`\n| `JEST_JUNIT_TITLE` | `titleTemplate` | Template string for the `name` attribute of `<testcase>`. | `\"{classname} {title}\"` | `{classname}`, `{title}`, `{filepath}`, `{filename}`, `{displayName}`\n| `JEST_JUNIT_ANCESTOR_SEPARATOR` | `ancestorSeparator` | Character(s) used to join the `describe` blocks. | `\" \"` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_ADD_FILE_ATTRIBUTE` | `addFileAttribute` | Add file attribute to the output. This config is primarily for Circle CI. This setting provides richer details but may break on other CI platforms. Must be a string. | `\"false\"` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_INCLUDE_CONSOLE_OUTPUT` | `includeConsoleOutput` | Adds console output to any testSuite that generates stdout during a test run. | `false` | N/A\n| `JEST_JUNIT_INCLUDE_SHORT_CONSOLE_OUTPUT` | `includeShortConsoleOutput` | Adds short console output (only message value) to any testSuite that generates stdout during a test run. | `false` | N/A\n| `JEST_USE_PATH_FOR_SUITE_NAME` | `usePathForSuiteName` | **DEPRECATED. Use `suiteNameTemplate` instead.** Use file path as the `name` attribute of `<testsuite>` | `\"false\"` | N/A\n\n\nYou can configure these options via the command line as seen below:\n\n```shell\nJEST_SUITE_NAME=\"Jest JUnit Unit Tests\" JEST_JUNIT_OUTPUT_DIR=\"./artifacts\" jest\n```\n\nOr you can also define a `jest-junit` key in your `package.json`.  All are **string** values.\n\n```\n{\n  ...\n  \"jest-junit\": {\n    \"suiteName\": \"jest tests\",\n    \"outputDirectory\": \".\",\n    \"outputName\": \"junit.xml\",\n    \"uniqueOutputName\": \"false\"\n    \"classNameTemplate\": \"{classname}-{title}\",\n    \"titleTemplate\": \"{classname}-{title}\",\n    \"ancestorSeparator\": \" › \",\n    \"usePathForSuiteName\": \"true\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr you can define your options in your reporter configuration.\n\n```js\n// jest.config.js\n{\n\treporters: [\n      \"default\",\n    \t[ \"jest-junit\", { suiteName: \"jest tests\" } ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n\n### Configuration Precedence\nIf using the `usePathForSuiteName` and `suiteNameTemplate`, the `usePathForSuiteName` value will take precedence. ie: if `usePathForSuiteName=true` and `suiteNameTemplate=\"{filename}\"`, the filepath will be used as the `name` attribute of the `<testsuite>` in the rendered `jest-junit.xml`).\n\n### Examples\n\nBelow are some example configuration values and the rendered `.xml` to created by `jest-junit`.\n\nThe following test defined in the file `/__tests__/addition.test.js` will be used for all examples:\n```js\ndescribe('addition', () => {\n  describe('positive numbers', () => {\n    it('should add up', () => {\n      expect(1 + 2).toBe(3);\n    });\n  });\n});\n```\n\n#### Example 1\nThe default output:\n\n```xml\n<testsuites name=\"jest tests\">\n  <testsuite name=\"addition\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"2017-07-13T09:42:28\" time=\"0.161\">\n    <testcase classname=\"addition positive numbers should add up\" name=\"addition positive numbers should add up\" time=\"0.004\">\n    </testcase>\n  </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\n#### Example 2\nUsing the `classNameTemplate` and `titleTemplate`:\n\n```shell\nJEST_JUNIT_CLASSNAME=\"{classname}\" JEST_JUNIT_TITLE=\"{title}\" jest\n```\n\nrenders\n\n```xml\n<testsuites name=\"jest tests\">\n  <testsuite name=\"addition\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"2017-07-13T09:45:42\" time=\"0.154\">\n    <testcase classname=\"addition positive numbers\" name=\"should add up\" time=\"0.005\">\n    </testcase>\n  </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\n#### Example 3\nUsing the `ancestorSeparator`:\n\n```shell\nJEST_JUNIT_ANCESTOR_SEPARATOR=\" › \" jest\n```\nrenders\n\n```xml\n<testsuites name=\"jest tests\">\n  <testsuite name=\"addition\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"2017-07-13T09:47:12\" time=\"0.162\">\n    <testcase classname=\"addition › positive numbers should add up\" name=\"addition › positive numbers should add up\" time=\"0.004\">\n    </testcase>\n  </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\n#### Example 4\nUsing the `suiteNameTemplate`:\n\n```shell\nJEST_JUNIT_SUITE_NAME =\"{filename}\" jest\n```\n\n```xml\n<testsuites name=\"jest tests\">\n  <testsuite name=\"addition.test.js\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"2017-07-13T09:42:28\" time=\"0.161\">\n    <testcase classname=\"addition positive numbers should add up\" name=\"addition positive numbers should add up\" time=\"0.004\">\n    </testcase>\n  </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```\n\n\n#### Example 5\nUsing `classNameTemplate` as a function in reporter options\n\n```js\n// jest.config.js\n{\n  reporters: [\n    \"default\",\n      [\n        \"jest-junit\",\n        {\n          classNameTemplate: (vars) => {\n            return vars.classname.toUpperCase();\n          }\n        }\n      ]\n  ]\n}\n```\n\nrenders\n\n```xml\n<testsuites name=\"jest tests\">\n  <testsuite name=\"addition\" tests=\"1\" errors=\"0\" failures=\"0\" skipped=\"0\" timestamp=\"2017-07-13T09:42:28\" time=\"0.161\">\n    <testcase classname=\"ADDITION POSITIVE NUMBERS\" name=\"addition positive numbers should add up\" time=\"0.004\">\n    </testcase>\n  </testsuite>\n</testsuites>\n```"
